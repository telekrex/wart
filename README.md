# Wart
A text adventure game framework, written in Python.

### Intentions
This is a work in progress! And just a side project, mostly for fun. The idea is that Wart is a framework for the story -- getting your narrative and player input rolling. The front end of your text adventure game could be built on top of it, using other tools. Contributions are welcome so long as they make sense and do not bloat the project. See philosophy, CONTRIBUTING.md, and ROADMAP.md for more.

### Philosophy
- Light
- Flexible
- Sandbox-like design
- Complexity from simplicity

### Who is this for?
Authors, game developers, programmers, hobbyists, tinkerers, and whoever wants to try!

### Requirements
Only Python is required. Wart uses only native libraries and modules.
