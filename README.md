# Wart
A light and flexible text adventure game engine, written in Python.

### Intentions
This is a work in progress! And just a side project, mostly for fun. Contributions are welcome so long as they make sense and do not bloat the project. See philosophy, CONTRIBUTING.md, and source/todo.txt for more.

### Philosophy
- Free, open source
- Non proprietary file formats
- As light as possible on resources
- Extremely easy to add or edit content
- Less engineering, more content
- Complexity resulting from simplicity
- Mechanics that empower recursive or emergent gameplay
- Not designed for a specific text adventure format
- Open enough in design for authors to drive both story and gameplay

### Who is this for?
Authors, game developers, programmers, hobbyists, tinkerers, and whoever else wants to try!
