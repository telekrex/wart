# Wart
A light and flexible text adventure game engine, written in Python.

### Intentions
This is a work in progress! And just a side project, mostly for fun. Contributions are welcome so long as they make sense and do not bloat the project. See philosophy, CONTRIBUTING.md, and source/todo.txt for more.

### Philosophy
- Free, open source
- Non proprietary file formats
- As light as possible on resources
- Complexity resulting from simplicity
- Sandbox-like text adventure game design

### Who is this for?
Authors, game developers, programmers, hobbyists, tinkerers, and whoever else wants to try!
