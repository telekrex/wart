<h1 align="center" style="margin-top: -10px"> Wart </h1>
<p align="center" style="width: 100;">
   An open source purely functional interactive fiction framework, written in Python.
</p>

### Intentions
A work in progress project I started for fun. Wart is for getting your narrative and input working, a front end could be built on top of it using other tools. Contributions are welcome so long as they make sense and do not bloat the project. See philosophy, CONTRIBUTING.md, and ROADMAP.md for more.

### Philosophy
- Light
- Flexible
- Purely functional
- Complexity from simplicity
- Native libraries only; stands up on its own
