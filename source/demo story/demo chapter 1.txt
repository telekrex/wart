# start
You awake on the ground, of dirt and black stone.

There's a hole next to you, and there's a light coming from inside.
There's also a chest nearby.
What would you like to do?

sleep, go to sleep, shut eyes, roll over, stay, stay on the ground, lay, lay there = sleep, nightmare
shout, scream, yell, call = callhelp
die = death

# enterhole
you enter the hole!
-
1 = death
2 = death

# openchest
You approach the chest and realize it's unlocked.
You peer inside, and find it's empty.
There's nothing else around you except the rocks and the hole, lit from below.
What would you like to do?
-
hole, enter hole, go in hole, crawl in hole, go down hole = enterhole
look around, look, see, check surroundings, turn around, get up, stand up, stand = stand
sleep, go to sleep, shut eyes, roll over, stay, stay on the ground, lay, lay there = sleep, nightmare

# death
You fall over and die, right there.
GAME OVER.
-

# callhelp
You scream for help, but no one answers.
-
? = ?

# stand
You stand up. The air is thin, and a bit chilly.
-
do stuff = awake
leave = leave


# sleep
You turn over and fall back asleep.
After a long darkness, you awake again.
The air feels the same, nothing has changed.
You are unsure how much time has passed, but you feel rested.
You are still laying next to a hole, and a chest.
What would you like to do?
-
hole, enter hole, go in hole, crawl in hole, go down hole = enterhole
chest, go to chest, open chest, examine chest, open the chest = openchest
look around, look, see, check surroundings, turn around, get up, stand up, stand = stand
sleep, go to sleep, shut eyes, roll over, stay, stay on the ground, lay, lay there = sleep, nightmare
shout, scream, yell, call = callhelp
die = death


# nightmare
You turn over and fall back asleep. Not long after, you feel an itch on your arm. Jolting awake, you see a black scorpion the size of a rabbit curiously crawling up your arm. Without hesitation, you shuffle to your feet - and a second, later the scorpion is gone. You are then back on the ground, now waking up from a false awakening. You are unsure how much time has passed, but you feel very, very awake now.
