Construction (Core)
1. make its mechanics work [x]
2. add fallbacks / error handling [x]
3. clean up the code [x]
4. clean up the terminal display
5. strengthen example content
6. make a pretty [optional] GUI (pygame?)
7. make it play different games by giving it a file that points to game content
8. make .exe?

Aspirational features I would like to add, but not until core construction is done:
- Items
- Inventory
- NPCs / conversations
- Display images
- Play audio
