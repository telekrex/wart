# Mechanics
User enters text
Need to sanitize the entry first (almost)
Find fitting hook from action
Randomly select from list of narratives if more than one
Use a default hook if no action works
Select a random hook if action is uncertain

Get it working first, then add inventory/items/clothes/scene stuff.
