# Contributing
Thank you for your interest!

Please use the **issue tracker** to:
- Leave feedback
- Suggest new features
- Report bugs or problems
- Propose code improvements
- Report security vulnerabilities
- Look for existing issues to solve

Modifications to the example story "beneath the world.txt" will probably not be accepted, as this is for demonstration purposes and, frankly, I quite like it the way it is. Please direct contribution efforts to code or documentation.


### Code standards/conventions
